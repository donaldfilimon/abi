# Build Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations applied to the ABI project.

## Build-Time Optimizations

### 1. Binary Size Reduction
- **Symbol Stripping**: Debug symbols are stripped in non-debug builds (`exe.strip = true`)
- **Section-based Linking**: Function and data sections are separated for better garbage collection
  - `exe.link_function_sections = true`
  - `exe.link_data_sections = true`
  - `exe.link_gc_sections = true` (removes unused sections)

### 2. Feature Flags
Features can be disabled at compile time to reduce bundle size:

```bash
# Minimal build (only core features)
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Denable-ai=false -Denable-gpu=false -Denable-web=false

# Production build with all features
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Size-optimized build
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```

### 3. Optimization Modes

| Mode | Use Case | Size | Speed |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| `Debug` | Development | Large | Slow |
| `ReleaseSafe` | Production (recommended) | Medium | Fast |
| `ReleaseFast` | Performance-critical | Medium | Very Fast |
| `ReleaseSmall` | Embedded/constrained | Small | Fast |

## Runtime Optimizations

### 1. Conditional Compilation
Features are conditionally compiled based on build options:
- AI features: `-Denable-ai=true/false`
- GPU features: `-Denable-gpu=true/false`
- Database features: `-Denable-database=true/false`
- Web features: `-Denable-web=true/false`
- Monitoring: `-Denable-monitoring=true/false`

### 2. SIMD Optimizations
Vector operations use SIMD when available:
- 4-wide F32 vectors for dot products
- Vectorized addition/multiplication
- Platform-specific CPU features detected at compile time

### 3. Allocator Strategy
- Use `ArenaAllocator` for temporary/batch operations
- Use `FixedBufferAllocator` for stack-allocated buffers
- `GeneralPurposeAllocator` only when dynamic allocation needed

## Performance Benchmarks

Run benchmarks to measure performance:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
zig build run-bench

# Run specific benchmarks
zig build run-bench -- simd
zig build run-bench -- database
zig build run-bench -- performance
```

## Load Time Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Module Loading
Features are loaded on-demand rather than eagerly imported.

### 2. Reduced Dependency Chain
Each feature module has minimal cross-dependencies.

### 3. Compile-Time Configuration
Build options are resolved at compile time, eliminating runtime checks.

## Recommended Build Commands

### Development
```bash
zig build
```

### Production
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

### Minimal Size
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall \
  -Denable-ai=false \
  -Denable-gpu=false \
  -Denable-monitoring=false
```

### Maximum Performance
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Profiling

Use the performance profiler to identify bottlenecks:

```bash
zig build tools
./zig-out/tools/performance_profiler
```

## Expected Improvements

Based on these optimizations:
- **Binary size**: 20-40% reduction with feature flags
- **Load time**: 15-30% improvement with lazy loading
- **Runtime performance**: 10-50% improvement with SIMD and optimizations
- **Compile time**: Faster incremental builds with modular structure
