# Branch Status Overview

This repository snapshot currently contains a single local branch named `work` and no
configured remotes. As a result, there are no additional branches to merge into a
`main` branch, and pushing to an upstream repository is not possible from this
environment.

To merge external branches into `main`, first fetch them from the remote and then
perform the merges locally before pushing back to the remote:

```sh
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git merge origin/<branch-name>
git push origin main
```

If additional branches are introduced in the future, rerun `git branch -a` to inspect
them and repeat the process above for each branch that must be integrated into
`main`.
