# WDBX-AI Definitions Reference

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Vector Database
A specialized database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently. Unlike traditional databases that store scalar values, vector databases are optimized for similarity search operations using metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product.

**Key characteristics:**
- **High-dimensional storage**: Handles vectors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions
- **Similarity search**: Finds vectors most similar to a query vector
- **Indexing algorithms**: Uses specialized indices like HNSW, IVF, or LSH for fast retrieval
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle millions or billions of vectors

### Embeddings
Dense vector representations of data (text, images, audio, etc.) that capture semantic meaning in a continuous vector space. Embeddings are typically generated by machine learning models and enable similarity comparisons between different data points.

**Examples:**
- **Text embeddings**: "cat" and "kitten" have similar vector representations
- **Image embeddings**: Photos of similar objects cluster together in vector space
- **Audio embeddings**: Similar sounds or music pieces have nearby representations

### HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
A graph-based indexing algorithm that builds a multi-layered network of connections between vectors. It provides excellent performance for approximate nearest neighbor search with logarithmic time complexity.

**Structure:**
- **Bottom layer**: Contains all vectors with short-range connections
- **Upper layers**: Contain subsets of vectors with long-range connections
- **Navigation**: Search starts from top layer and progressively moves down

**Parameters:**
- `M`: Maximum number of connections per vector (typically 16-64)
- `efConstruction`: Size of candidate set during construction (typically 200-800)
- `efSearch`: Size of candidate set during search (affects recall vs speed trade-off)

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning

### Neural Network
A computational model inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection has a weight that determines the strength of the signal passed between neurons.

**Architecture components:**
- **Input layer**: Receives raw data features
- **Hidden layers**: Process and transform the input through weighted connections
- **Output layer**: Produces final predictions or classifications
- **Activation functions**: Non-linear functions that introduce complexity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)

### Backpropagation
The fundamental algorithm for training neural networks. It calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight by propagating errors backwards through the network, then updates weights to minimize the loss.

**Process:**
1. **Forward pass**: Input flows through network to produce output
2. **Loss calculation**: Compare output to target, calculate error
3. **Backward pass**: Propagate error gradients back through layers
4. **Weight update**: Adjust weights using gradients and learning rate

### Gradient Descent
An optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize a loss function. It moves in the direction of steepest descent of the loss landscape.

**Variants:**
- **Batch gradient descent**: Uses entire dataset for each update
- **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**: Uses one sample at a time
- **Mini-batch gradient descent**: Uses small batches (typically 32-256 samples)

**Hyperparameters:**
- **Learning rate**: Step size for parameter updates (typically 0.001-0.1)
- **Momentum**: Helps overcome local minima and speeds convergence
- **Weight decay**: Regularization term to prevent overfitting

### Agent-Based Systems
Autonomous software entities that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In AI systems, agents can be simple rule-based systems or complex neural networks.

**Components:**
- **Perception**: Sensors to observe environment state
- **Decision making**: Logic or learned behavior to choose actions
- **Action**: Effectors to modify the environment
- **Memory**: Storage of past experiences and learned knowledge

**Types:**
