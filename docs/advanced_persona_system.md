# Advanced Persona System Example

This document describes the optional `advanced_persona_system.zig` module.
The code demonstrates a more complex AI architecture with lock-free agent
coordination and a KD-tree based expertise index. It is provided as a
reference design and is not compiled as part of the main build.

- **AgentCoordinationSystem** manages agents using a lock-free pool.
- **ExpertiseIndex** performs expertise lookup via a KD-tree.
- **Processing** can run in parallel, sequential, or hierarchical modes.

The module is self-contained but uses placeholder implementations for
complex components such as `Agent` processing logic. You can study it to
understand how a larger system could be organized in Zig.

This example is intended purely for research and may require additional components to compile.
