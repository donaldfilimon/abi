# Advanced Persona System Example

This document describes the optional `advanced_persona_system.zig` module.
The code demonstrates a more complex AI architecture with lock-free agent
coordination and a KD-tree based expertise index. It is provided as a
reference design and is not compiled as part of the main build.

- **AgentCoordinationSystem** manages agents using a lock-free pool.
- **ExpertiseIndex** performs expertise lookup via a KD-tree.
- **Processing** can run in parallel, sequential, or hierarchical modes.

The module is self-contained but uses placeholder implementations for
complex components such as `Agent` processing logic. You can study it to
understand how a larger system could be organized in Zig.

This example is intended purely for research and may require additional components to compile.

## Recent Improvements

The advanced persona system has been enhanced with the following improvements:

### 1. Memory Safety and Error Handling
- Added proper bounds checking and safe casting in lock-free operations
- Implemented backoff strategy in `allocateSlot` to reduce contention
- Added validation for slot allocation state before setting agents
- Proper error propagation throughout the system

### 2. Resource Management
- Added `deinit` methods for all components (AgentRegistry, KDTree, ExpertiseIndex)
- Proper cleanup of allocated resources to prevent memory leaks
- Safe agent reference clearing to prevent use-after-free

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Atomic agent ID generation for thread-safe unique IDs
- Agent count tracking with atomic operations
- Input validation and query size limits
- Timeout monitoring for query processing

### 4. Enhanced Agent Implementation
- Agents now track state (active status, request count)
- Proper agent instantiation from definitions
- Meaningful processing logic based on expertise domains
- Memory-safe response generation

### 5. Mathematical Operations
- Implemented proper vector normalization
- Added dot product calculation for similarity matching
- Enhanced KD-tree search algorithm

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- Added extensive test suite covering all major components
- Concurrent allocation stress tests
- Error handling validation
- Memory safety verification

## Usage Example

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const aps = @import("advanced_persona_system.zig");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();
    
    // Initialize the coordination system
    var system = aps.AgentCoordinationSystem.init(allocator);
    defer system.agent_registry.deinit();
    
    // Register specialized agents
    const expertise = [_]aps.ExpertiseDomain{
        .{ .name = "natural_language", .proficiency = 0.9 },
        .{ .name = "code_analysis", .proficiency = 0.8 },
    };
    
    const agent_def = aps.AgentDefinition{
        .expertise_domains = &expertise,
    };
    
    const agent_id = try system.agent_registry.registerAgent(agent_def);
    std.debug.print("Registered agent with ID: {}\n", .{agent_id.value});
    
    // Process a query
    const query = "Analyze this code for potential improvements";
    const context = aps.QueryContext{ .user_meta = "developer" };
    const user_id = aps.UserId{};
    
    const result = try system.processQuery(query, context, user_id);
    defer allocator.free(result.response);
    
    std.debug.print("Response: {s}\n", .{result.response});
}
```

## Building and Testing

To run the tests for the advanced persona system:

```bash
zig test src/advanced_persona_system_test.zig
```

Note: The advanced persona system is not included in the main build by default. To use it in your project, import it directly.
