# Cross-Platform Testing Reference

_Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}_

This guide documents how the repository exercises platform-specific behaviour and keeps the automated pipeline aligned with the
supported matrix. The catalog below is regenerated by `scripts/enhance_cross_platform_testing.sh` so that documentation reflects
what currently lives under `tests/cross-platform/`.

## Supported Platforms

- **Linux** – Validates `/proc` access, epoll support, and filesystem semantics. Tests are guarded so they skip gracefully when
  the host environment does not expose the required facilities.
- **macOS** – Exercises file-system interactions and Mach time availability to ensure the abstractions remain portable.
- **Windows** – Confirms path handling and Winsock operations with runtime guards around the host operating system.

## Running the Suite

- `zig build test` executes the standard suite configured in `build.zig`, which wires in the cross-platform checks through the
  aggregated unit test target.
- When debugging a specific OS shim, run `zig test tests/cross-platform/<os>.zig` directly so the guards can skip cleanly on
  incompatible hosts.

## Continuous Integration Coverage

GitHub Actions runs the build, unit tests, documentation generation, and formatting checks on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners
using the pinned Zig nightly defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, providing coverage for the same OS families targeted by the
smoke tests.

## Test Catalog

The section below is generated automatically; run the helper script whenever new smoke tests land:

```bash
scripts/enhance_cross_platform_testing.sh
```

<!-- BEGIN: cross-platform-test-catalog -->

### Linux (`tests/cross-platform/linux.zig`)
- Linux file operations
- Linux epoll

### macOS (`tests/cross-platform/macos.zig`)
- macOS file operations
- macOS networking

### Windows (`tests/cross-platform/windows.zig`)
- Windows file operations
- Windows networking
