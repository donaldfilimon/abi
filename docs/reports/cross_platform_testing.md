# Cross-Platform Testing Reference

This guide documents how the repository exercises platform-specific behaviour and keeps the automated pipeline aligned with the supported matrix.

## Supported Platforms
- Linux smoke tests validate `/proc` access and epoll support while skipping gracefully when the environment does not expose the required facilities.【F:tests/cross-platform/linux.zig†L1-L27】
- macOS smoke tests assert file-system interactions and Mach timing availability.【F:tests/cross-platform/macos.zig†L1-L26】
- Windows smoke tests confirm path handling and Winsock operations with runtime guards around the host operating system.【F:tests/cross-platform/windows.zig†L1-L32】

## Running the Suite
- Use `zig build test` for the standard suite configured in `build.zig`, which already wires in the cross-platform checks through the aggregated unit test target.【F:build.zig†L40-L54】
- When debugging a specific OS shim, run `zig test` against the corresponding file directly (for example `zig test tests/cross-platform/linux.zig`) so the guards can skip cleanly on incompatible hosts.【F:tests/cross-platform/linux.zig†L5-L27】

## Continuous Integration Coverage
GitHub Actions runs the build, unit tests, documentation generation, and formatting checks on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows using the pinned Zig nightly, providing coverage for the same OS families targeted by the smoke tests.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L33】

## Test Catalog
The list below is regenerated by `scripts/enhance_cross_platform_testing.sh` to ensure the reference stays in sync with the smoke tests checked into `tests/cross-platform/`.
