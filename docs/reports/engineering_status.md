# Engineering Status Overview

This overview replaces the sprawling status reports with a concise reference that reflects the current repository layout, the active feature modules, and the supporting automation.

## Framework Snapshot
- The framework runtime owns feature toggles, plugin discovery, and lifecycle management, including optional automatic discovery, registration, and start-up of plugins when the corresponding switches are enabled in the provided options structure.【F:src/framework/runtime.zig†L7-L116】
- Feature families such as AI, database, web, monitoring, GPU, connectors, and SIMD are represented by the `Feature` enumeration and configured through the `FeatureToggles` helper, allowing summaries and selective enablement during initialization.【F:src/framework/config.zig†L4-L110】

## Feature Modules
The framework aggregates functionality into dedicated feature bundles to keep imports predictable:

- **AI module** – Exposes neural, transformer, reinforcement learning, agent, and serialization primitives used by higher-level tooling.【F:src/features/ai/mod.zig†L1-L27】
- **Database module** – Provides the vector database core, sharding extensions, CLI surface, and supporting utilities for persistence workloads.【F:src/features/database/mod.zig†L1-L23】
- **Web module** – Supplies HTTP gateway, client, and infrastructure helpers for service deployment scenarios.【F:src/features/web/mod.zig†L1-L27】
- **Monitoring module** – Bundles telemetry, metrics, and health-check definitions to keep observability code isolated.【F:src/features/monitoring/mod.zig†L1-L17】
- **GPU module** – Groups GPU kernels and shared infrastructure so accelerated paths can be toggled independently of the CPU implementations.【F:src/features/gpu/mod.zig†L1-L21】

## Build and Tooling
- `build.zig` defines the reusable `abi` library, the CLI executable, and exposes `run`, `test`, `docs`, `fmt`, and `summary` steps so downstream tooling can drive consistent workflows.【F:build.zig†L4-L74】
- Build-time options expose flags such as `enable-ansi`, `strict-io`, and `experimental`, and surface them to both the library and CLI modules for coherent behavior across entry points.【F:build.zig†L6-L34】

## Testing and Continuous Integration
- The default `zig build test` target executes `tests/test_create.zig` along with any additional suites wired into the build graph.【F:build.zig†L40-L54】
- OS-specific smoke tests under `tests/cross-platform` exercise Linux, macOS, and Windows system boundaries by gating each test on `builtin.os.tag`.【F:tests/cross-platform/linux.zig†L1-L27】【F:tests/cross-platform/macos.zig†L1-L26】【F:tests/cross-platform/windows.zig†L1-L32】
- GitHub Actions run the build, tests, documentation generation, and formatting checks on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners using the pinned `0.16.0-dev` Zig toolchain.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L33】

## Documentation
- Project documentation, including this report, lives under `docs/` with the static site published via the `zig build docs` pipeline described in the CI workflow.【F:build.zig†L55-L74】【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L17-L33】
- Additional deep dives—such as deployment guidance and module-level walkthroughs—remain available alongside this overview in the `docs/` tree for teams that need the extended narrative.【F:docs/README.md†L1-L36】
