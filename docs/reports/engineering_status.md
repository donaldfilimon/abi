# Engineering Status Overview

This document consolidates the high-level engineering reports that previously lived at the root of the repository. It provides a single entry point for release readiness, platform coverage, benchmarking, and migration status.

## Codebase Quality & Tooling
- Adopted comprehensive linting and formatting rules across the Zig workspace to enforce consistent style and module structure.
- Added static-analysis helpers (including `tools/basic_code_analyzer.zig`) to surface API drift, dependency issues, and dead code before landing changes.
- Expanded the regression suite with scenario coverage for runtime, GPU integration, concurrency primitives, and failure-injection harnesses.
- Hardened CI with quality gates, artifact retention, and reusable workflows so new features inherit the same review baseline.

## Utility Library Completion
- Closed out all high/medium priority utilities: memory tracking helpers, JSON/URL codecs, Base64, validation pipelines, random data sources, and math helpers.
- Standardized error handling and cleanup patterns through shared utility modules to prevent allocator leaks or inconsistent diagnostics.
- Documented usage snippets for each utility domain to speed up adoption during feature work.

## Benchmark & Performance Suite
- Rebuilt the benchmark framework to emit statistical summaries (mean, median, deviation, confidence intervals) along with JSON/CSV/Markdown exports for CI ingestion.
- Unified benchmark runners for AI workloads, database access, SIMD micro-benchmarks, and foundational primitives with shared configuration knobs.
- Instrumented performance harnesses with memory tracking and platform metadata so regressions can be triaged quickly across OS/architecture pairs.

## Cross-Platform Coverage
- Codified the OS/architecture/Zig matrix (Windows Server 2019/2022, macOS 13/14 Intel & Apple Silicon, Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04 on x86_64/aarch64).
- Provisioned dedicated test targets (`tests/cross-platform/{windows,macos,linux}.zig`) with environment-specific checks for filesystems, networking, and event loops.
- Published an evergreen testing guide that captures CI settings, troubleshooting steps, and best practices for conditional compilation (`docs/reports/cross_platform_testing.md`).

## Deployment Readiness
- Curated production deployment workflows covering single-server, container, and Kubernetes strategies with environment variables, feature flags, and artifact outputs.
- Verified staging performance (â‰ˆ2.8K ops/sec, sub-millisecond latency, 99.98% success rate) and established validation gates before production rollout.
- Bundled monitoring assets (Prometheus, Grafana dashboards) plus rollback and incident-response procedures to maintain high availability.

## Zig 0.16 Migration Playbook
- Documented strategic objectives for the Zig 0.16-dev upgrade, including maintaining feature parity and unlocking GPU backends (Vulkan, Metal, CUDA).
- Broke migration into governable waves with ownership, risk registers, and reviewer exit criteria to keep progress measurable.
- Captured stdlib/build-system deltas, allocator policies, observability requirements, and security considerations to streamline future upgrades.
