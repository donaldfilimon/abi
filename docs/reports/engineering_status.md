# Engineering Status Overview

_Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}_

The goal of this report is to give contributors a quick pulse check on how the project is structured today, which build targets
are considered critical, and where automation already has coverage. Use it as a jumping-off point before diving into the
individual source directories.

## At a Glance

- **Runtime & lifecycle** – The runtime orchestrates feature toggles, plugin discovery, and startup/teardown flow. It is the
  entry point that wires optional subsystems together so the CLI and embedded applications behave consistently.
- **Feature families** – Feature bundles such as AI, database, web, monitoring, GPU, connectors, and SIMD live under
  `src/features/`. The `FeatureToggles` helper in `src/framework/config.zig` enables or disables them in one place.
- **Automation** – Continuous integration uses the pinned Zig toolchain to build, run tests, generate documentation, and check
  formatting on Linux, macOS, and Windows runners via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

---

## Framework Snapshot

- The runtime (`src/framework/runtime.zig`) owns the feature toggles, plugin discovery, and lifecycle management, including
  optional automatic registration and start-up of plugins when the corresponding switches are enabled.
- Feature families such as AI, database, web, monitoring, GPU, connectors, and SIMD are represented by the `Feature` enumeration
  and configured through `FeatureToggles`, allowing summaries and selective enablement during initialization.

## Feature Modules

The framework aggregates functionality into dedicated feature bundles to keep imports predictable:

- **AI module** (`src/features/ai/mod.zig`) – Neural, transformer, reinforcement learning, agent, and serialization primitives
  used by higher-level tooling.
- **Database module** (`src/features/database/mod.zig`) – Vector database core, sharding extensions, CLI surface, and supporting
  utilities for persistence workloads.
- **Web module** (`src/features/web/mod.zig`) – HTTP gateway, client, and infrastructure helpers for service deployment
  scenarios.
- **Monitoring module** (`src/features/monitoring/mod.zig`) – Telemetry, metrics, and health-check definitions to keep
  observability code isolated.
- **GPU module** (`src/features/gpu/mod.zig`) – GPU kernels and shared infrastructure so accelerated paths can be toggled
  independently of the CPU implementations.

## Build and Tooling

- `build.zig` defines the reusable `abi` library, the CLI executable, and exposes `run`, `test`, `docs`, `fmt`, and `summary`
  steps so downstream tooling can drive consistent workflows.
- Build-time options expose flags such as `enable-ansi`, `strict-io`, and `experimental`, and surface them to both the library
  and CLI modules for coherent behavior across entry points.

## Testing and Continuous Integration

- The default `zig build test` target executes `tests/test_create.zig` along with any additional suites wired into the build
  graph.
- OS-specific smoke tests under `tests/cross-platform` exercise Linux, macOS, and Windows system boundaries by gating each test
  on `builtin.os.tag`.
- GitHub Actions runs the build, tests, documentation generation, and formatting checks on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners
  using the pinned `0.16.0-dev` Zig toolchain.

## Documentation

- Project documentation, including this report, lives under `docs/` with the static site published via the `zig build docs`
  pipeline described in the CI workflow.
- Additional deep dives—such as deployment guidance and module-level walkthroughs—remain available alongside this overview in the
  `docs/` tree for teams that need the extended narrative.
