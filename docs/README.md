# Documentation Map
> **Codebase Status:** Synced with repository as of 2026-01-24.

A guide to the docs layout and primary entry points.

## Entry Points

- **Docs index**: `docs/docs-index.md` — curated table of contents
- **Getting started**: `docs/intro.md` and `docs/tutorials/getting-started.md`
- **API reference**: `docs/api/index.md`
- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- **Migration**: `docs/migration/zig-0.16-migration.md`

## Directory Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/api/` | API reference pages (generated + curated) |
| `docs/architecture/` | Architecture overviews and interfaces |
| `docs/analysis/` | Deep-dive analysis and internal research notes |
| `docs/diagrams/` | System and dataflow diagrams |
| `docs/migration/` | Version migration guides |
| `docs/plans/` | Planning docs (active + archived) |
| `docs/research/` | Long-form research notes and whitepapers |
| `docs/tutorials/` | Guided walkthroughs and code examples |
| `docs/training/` | Training and fine-tuning guides |
| `docs/assets/` | Static assets for docs (CSS/JS) |

## Conventions

- Use relative links within `docs/`.
- Keep API reference pages under `docs/api/`.
- Prefer short, topic-first filenames (e.g., `gpu.md`, `ai-training.md`).
