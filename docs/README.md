# ABI Documentation

This site accompanies the ABI framework and keeps the focus on the actual Zig
code that ships in the repository. The majority of the content is generated by
the compiler so you always have an up-to-date view of the modules, structs, and
tests that make up the runtime.

## Quick Links

- **[Compiler Docs](./zig-docs/)** – Output of `zig build docs` for the `abi`
  library module.
- **[API Reference](./generated/API_REFERENCE/)** – High level index produced by
  the historical doc generator (kept for convenience).
- **Deployment status** – Documentation updates are now deployed exclusively
  by the dedicated GitHub Pages workflow to keep CI fast and deterministic.
- **[Module Overview](./generated/MODULE_REFERENCE/)** – Describes how the
  runtime is organised and where to find feature toggles, plugin management, and
  shared utilities.

## How to Regenerate

```bash
zig build docs
open zig-out/docs/index.html   # or use your preferred static file server
```

The build writes into `zig-out/docs`. The Jekyll layout under `docs/` simply
embeds those artefacts so that GitHub Pages can host them without needing
additional tooling.

## What You'll Find

- **Feature toggles** – Detailed documentation for the `framework.config`
  module which describes each runtime feature flag.
- **Plugin registry** – API docs for discovery helpers, loader hooks, and the
  summarisation routines used by the CLI.
- **Examples** – Direct links to the smoke tests and example programs that ship
  with the repository.

This site intentionally avoids marketing fluff. If something is documented, you
can find the implementation in `src/`.

## Need Help?

- File an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/donaldfilimon/abi/issues).
- Start a discussion if you have questions about extending the runtime or
  writing your own plugins.
- If you spot inaccuracies in the generated docs, please open a PR that updates
  the corresponding Zig source so the compiler output stays correct.
