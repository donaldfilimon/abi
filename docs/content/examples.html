<p>
Examples are compiled and wired into the build system. Use them to validate
your toolchain and learn module usage patterns.
</p>

<h2>Build all examples</h2>
<pre><code>zig build examples
</code></pre>

<h2>Run individual examples</h2>
<pre><code>zig build run-hello
zig build run-database
zig build run-gpu
</code></pre>

<h2>Where to look</h2>
<p>
Example sources live in the examples/ directory and are kept small and focused.
They are a good starting point for custom integrations.
