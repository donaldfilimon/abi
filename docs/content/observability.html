Observability covers logging, metrics, profiling, and health checks. These tools
help validate performance and reliability during deployment.
</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>
Logs use structured formats and include module names. Set log levels per
environment to balance signal and noise.
</p>

<h2>Metrics and profiling</h2>
<pre><code>zig build -Denable-profiling=true
zig build run -- system-info
</code></pre>

<h2>Health checks</h2>
<p>
Streaming services expose health endpoints. Integrate them with load balancers
and container orchestration for automatic restarts.
