# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 0.1.x   | Yes       |
| < 0.1   | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately using GitHub Security Advisories.
Include reproduction steps, impact assessment, and suggested fixes.

## Best Practices
- Use the latest supported version.
- Keep Zig updated.
- Validate untrusted inputs and sandbox untrusted code.

## Notes
The CLI is minimal by design; most deployments should embed ABI as a library.
