# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of ABI with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly
Send details to: [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 4. Disclosure process
- We will work with you to coordinate disclosure
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless requested otherwise)
- Public disclosure will occur after a fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Always use the latest supported version
- Keep your Zig compiler updated
- Review code before running in production
- Use appropriate sandboxing for untrusted code

### For Contributors
- Follow secure coding practices
- Run security analysis tools (`zig build analyze`)
- Review all dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Test changes thoroughly before submitting PRs

## Security Features

ABI includes several security-focused features:

- **Memory Safety**: Zig's compile-time memory safety checks
- **Static Analysis**: Built-in static analysis tools
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the codebase
- **AI Content Safety**: Content filtering and safety measures for AI-generated responses
- **API Security**: JWT authentication and rate limiting for web endpoints
- **Resource Isolation**: Plugin sandboxing and resource limits
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Network Security**: TLS/SSL support and secure connection handling

## Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities. If you find a security issue in a dependency, please report it to both the dependency maintainer and us.

## Security Tools

The project includes several security analysis tools:

```bash
# Run static analysis
zig build analyze

# Run security-focused tests
zig build test-all

# Performance and memory profiling
zig build profile

# Memory leak detection
zig build test-memory

# Security audit (if available)
zig build security-audit

# Input validation tests
zig build test-validation
```

## AI Security Considerations

### Content Safety
- **Content Filtering**: AI responses are filtered for inappropriate content
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Memory Isolation**: AI operations run in isolated memory spaces

### Data Protection
- **No Data Persistence**: Chat conversations are not permanently stored by default
- **Encrypted Communications**: All API communications support encryption
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
