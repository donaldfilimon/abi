## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **GPU Acceleration**: WebGPU with platform-specific fallbacks
- **SIMD Optimizations**: 3GB/s+ throughput with alignment safety
- **Lock-free Concurrency**: Wait-free data structures
- **Vector Database**: Custom WDBX-AI format for embeddings
- **Neural Networks**: SIMD-accelerated operations
- **Plugin System**: Cross-platform dynamic loading
- **Production Servers**: HTTP/TCP with fault tolerance

### Platform Support
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS
- **Platform Optimizations**: OS-specific enhancements
- **Discord Integration**: Bot framework with gateway support

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Zig 0.16.0-dev.254+6dd0270a1** (see `.zigversion` and verify with `zig version`)
- GPU drivers (optional, for acceleration)
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)

### Compatibility

- **Current Toolchain**: Zig 0.16.0-dev.254+6dd0270a1. This repository's `.zigversion` file is the authoritative reference—match it exactly when installing Zig.
- **Legacy Notes**: Historical guidance for Zig 0.15.x (including CI setups using `mlugg/setup-zig@v2` with Zig 0.15.0) remains in older sections below for teams maintaining legacy deployments. These paths are not part of the active test matrix.

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/donaldfilimon/abi.git
cd abi
zig build
zig build test
./zig-out/bin/abi
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const abi = @import("abi");

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;

    // Create AI agent using the exported AgentConfig
    var agent = try abi.features.ai.agent.Agent.init(allocator, .{ .name = "QuickStart" });
    defer agent.deinit();

    // Process a message
    const response = try agent.process("Hello!", allocator);
    defer allocator.free(@constCast(response));
}
```

> `Agent.process` duplicates its reply into the allocator you provide, so callers must free the returned buffer once they're
> done with it.

### Vector Database
```zig
// Open database
var db = try abi.features.database.database.Db.open("vectors.wdbx", true);
defer db.close();

// Add and search vectors
const embedding = [_]f32{0.1, 0.2, 0.3};
const results = try db.search(&embedding, 10, allocator);
```

### WDBX CLI (roadmap)

Dedicated WDBX commands are part of the planned CLI experience and are being prototyped in `src/tools/main.zig`. The installed executable built from `src/main.zig` does not currently expose these subcommands.

## Modules

- **`core/`**: Core utilities and framework foundation
- **`framework/`**: Runtime orchestrator that wires features and plugins together
- **`ai/`**: AI agents and machine learning components
- **`database/`**: WDBX-AI vector database with HNSW indexing
- **`net/`**: HTTP/TCP servers and client libraries
- **`simd/`**: SIMD-accelerated operations
- **`perf/`**: Performance monitoring and profiling
- **`gpu/`**: GPU acceleration and rendering
- **`ml/`**: Machine learning algorithms

## CLI

### Default executable (`src/main.zig`)

The `zig build` output initialises the framework, captures its human-readable startup summary, and writes both the banner and summary to standard output before exiting. No runtime flags or subcommands are currently recognised.

```bash
zig build
./zig-out/bin/abi
```

This prints `ABI Framework bootstrap complete` followed by the structured framework summary generated by `framework.writeSummary`.

### Experimental CLI prototype (`src/tools/main.zig`)

An expanded command-line interface—including GPU, database, and chat helpers—is under active development. To try it locally, invoke the tool directly via Zig:

```bash
zig run src/tools/main.zig -- --help
```

This command builds the prototype on the fly and shows the available experimental subcommands. The tool is not packaged or installed by default; expect frequent breaking changes while it incubates.

## Planned services and benchmarks

The richer HTTP/API surface and benchmarking harness described in earlier iterations depend on the forthcoming CLI wrapper and supporting subsystems. They are not yet exposed by the default binary. For design notes and roadmap context, explore the documents under [`docs/`](docs/) and the summaries in the repository root (for example, `CODEBASE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`).

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests registered in build.zig (currently exercises src/main.zig)
zig build test

# Targeted test files
zig test tests/test_create.zig
zig test tests/cross-platform/linux.zig
zig test tests/cross-platform/macos.zig
zig test tests/cross-platform/windows.zig
```

The cross-platform tests gracefully skip when run on unsupported operating systems, so it's
safe to invoke the full list from any development environment.

**Quality Metrics:**
- Memory Safety: Zero leaks
- Performance: <5% regression tolerance
- Test Coverage: 95%+
- Build Success: 99%+
