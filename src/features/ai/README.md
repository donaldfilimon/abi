//! AI Feature Overview
//!
//! This module implements AI‑related capabilities such as model registration,
//! federated learning coordination, training pipelines, and transformer
//! utilities. It is structured into sub‑modules:
//!   - `mod.zig` – Public API aggregation.
//!   - `agent.zig` – Agent orchestration primitives.
//!   - `model_registry.zig` – Runtime model lookup and versioning.
//!   - `training/` – Training‑specific helpers (checkpointing, gradient
//!     management, and optimizer state).
//!   - `transformer/` – Core transformer building blocks.
//!
//! See the individual files for detailed documentation.
