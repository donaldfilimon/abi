Current state:
- Implement approved plan for code fixes + consensus artifact commits + branch push.
- Local changes: bindings/c/src/abi_c.zig, src/services/shared/utils/zig_toolchain.zig, and tasks/consensus artifacts.

Constraints:
- Mandatory best-effort consensus preflight.
- Two commits: code then consensus artifacts.
- Run full verification before commit and push.

Decision question:
- Confirm safest sequencing for validation, commit split, and push execution with minimal churn.
