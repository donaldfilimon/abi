current state:
- Implementing wave-2 follow-up on top of commit 6facea46 in ..
- Dirty changes currently: bindings/c/src/abi_c.zig, src/services/shared/utils/zig_toolchain.zig, and tasks/consensus artifacts.
constraints/non-goals:
- Keep symbols filter behavior as modules+symbols.
- Include all current changes in one commit.
- Preserve deterministic zig-master checks.
success criteria:
- All zig-master checks pass.
- Consensus artifacts are sanitized before commit.
decision question:
- Any high-risk caveats in this mixed-source commit flow?
