Current state:
- Working tree has local modifications in bindings/c/src/abi_c.zig and src/services/shared/utils/zig_toolchain.zig.
- Untracked consensus artifacts exist under tasks/consensus/.
- Requested action: implement stabilization/fix plan and produce commit-ready tree with full verification.

Constraints:
- Minimal-risk fixes that preserve intended behavior.
- Keep consensus artifacts.
- Verify with strict workflow gate and full verify-all.

Decision question:
- Confirm safest execution order to finalize these local changes and validation with minimal churn.
