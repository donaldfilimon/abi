      "answer": "We need to provide a strategy to merge non-main branches into main. The context: user has repository at /Users/donaldfilimon/abi, branch main, local branches backup/pre-fix-resolution, fix/c-api-paths-consensus-20260302, fix/stabilization-wave2, main. Remote branches include origin/organize-zig-0.16-master-files-* refs not yet local. Working tree clean. Constraints: non-interactive git flow only, deterministic Zig workflow, preserve validation gates, no history rewrite on main. Goal: merge integration, not branch cleanup/deletion. Success criteria: merge-target branches integrated into local main with no unresolved conflicts. main remains build/validation healthy under Zig checks. Provide concise risk summary. Decision question: safest deterministic merge strategy to integrate all non-main local+origin branches into main while minimizing conflict risk and preserving validation confidence? So answer: propose strategy: fetch all, then use rebase onto main for each feature branch, test, then merge fast-forward or merge commit. Use git merge --no-ff maybe. Use \":-1.0, \" maybe not. Also use git merge --no-ff and commit, but we want deterministic: use 'git merge -s ours' maybe? No, but need actual content. We need to preserve validation, so do tests after each merge. Use 'git merge --no-commit' then run Zig validation. If passes, commit. If fails, abort. We can use \":-1.0, \" but we need to propose safe strategy: \": -1.0, \" no. Actually we need to mention using git merge --no-ff, and if conflict, resolve manually. But need deterministic: use 'git merge --no-ff --strategy-option theirs' or 'ours'? But that might override changes. Instead, use \":-1.0, \" not relevant. Let's propose using \": -1.0, \" again not relevant. We can propose using 'git merge --no-ff' with --no-commit and then run 'zig build test' etc. Also propose \": -1.0, \" no. Might mention \":-1.0, \" no. I'm overthinking. Let's produce answer.**Recommended deterministic merge workflow** \u2013 \u201cOne\u2011by\u2011One, test\u2011first, fast\u2011forward\u2011safe\u201d \u2013 for integrating every local + remote non\u2011main branch into `main` while keeping Zig validation healthy and never rewriting history on `main` (and leaving the branches untouched after the merge). It can be executed entirely with git\u2011CLI and a single script, so it fits the *non\u2011interactive* constraint and preserves the deterministic Zig build\u2011pipeline. The steps below can be copy\u2011a",
